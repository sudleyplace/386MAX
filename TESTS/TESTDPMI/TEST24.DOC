TEST24	 -- Version 2.00 -- A DPMI Critical Error Test Program
   (C) Copyright 1992 Qualitas, Inc.  GNU General Public License version 3.

This program tests Critical Errror under a DPMI host.  The program
syntax is as follows:

Syntax:  TEST24 [options]

where options consists one or more of

/P=n where n=0 (IGNORE), 1 (RETRY), 2 (ABORT), 3 (FAIL), 4 (JMPF), 5 (CALLF)
     for PM INT 24h setting
/V=n where n=0 (IGNORE), 1 (RETRY), 2 (ABORT), 3 (FAIL), 4 (JMPF), 5 (CALLF)
     for VM INT 24h setting
/S   Enter PM as small (16-bit) DPMI client

To install a PM handler only, use /P=n without /V=n, and vice versa.
To install both handlers with the PM handler first, use /P=n /V=n.  To
install the VM handler first, use /V=n /P=n.

The /P= and /V= options are order-dependent:  in case it makes a
difference in your host implementation, the interrupt handlers are
installed in the same order as the /P= or /V= keywords are specified
on the command line.  If your implementation is not order-dependent,
and you are testing with both handlers installed, place the handler
which is called first on the right.  For example, with 386MAX as the
host, the PM handler is always called first even if there is a VM
handler installed.  In this case, always use the form /V=n /P=n.

All handlers are installed after the switch from VM to PM is made (and
are done through DPMI calls).

The different values for /P= and /V= are described as follows:

0	 The handler tells DOS to IGNORE the error.

1	 The handler tells DOS to RETRY the error.

2	 The handler tells DOS to ABORT the program.

3	 The handler tells DOS to FAIL the DOS call.

4	 The handler CHAINs to the next handler in sequence via JMPF
	   which should cause the host to ignore this handler.

5	 The handler CHAINs to the next handler in sequence via CALLF
	   which should cause the host to ignore this handler.	Note
	   that if the CALLF handler is called first, it should
	   continue execution following the CALLF; TEST24 tests to
	   see that that happens.

The first four values (0-3) cause the handler to make a decision.
The last two values (4-5) do not.

The program tests that the following rules are followed:

R1.  If the PM handler only is installed, then the resulting actions
for values /P=0 to 3 should be identical to the resulting actions were
the VM handler only installed, and vice versa.	That is, it shouldn't
matter whether the decision is made in PM or VM if it's the same
decision.

R2.  If both handlers are installed and the first handler called makes
a decision (values 0-3), then the other handler is not called.

R3.  If both handlers are installed and the first handler called does
not make a decision (values 4-5), then the resulting actions are the
same as if the second handler only were installed.  That is, chaining
is equivalent to not being installed.


Some questions occur for which the TEST24 program assumes specific
answers but which may be different in your implementation:

Q1.  If both handlers are installed, which one is called first?

A1a.  The PM handler;
A1b.  The VM handler (???);
A1c.  The last one which was hooked (that is, the order in which INT
	24h is hooked by PM and VM is significant);
A1d.  The first one which was hooked (???).

My reading of the DPMI spec says that such interrupts should be
reflected to PM first, then VM.  Thus, 386MAX calls the PM handler
first.	Your mileage may differ.


Q2.  If no handlers are installed, what is the default action?

A2a.  Take a specific action such as FAIL.
A2b.  Pass the event on to the next handler in sequence which means
      DOS then asks the time-honored question "Abort, Retry, Ignore,
      or Fail?"

The answer for 386MAX is to take the same action as DOS does for a VM
program without DPMI, which is to pass the event on to the next
handler in sequence.

For reference, the settings and actions taken by 386MAX are as
follows:

Please get back to me with your comments on these rules, how your DPMI
host interprets Critical Error, what your DPMI client expects, how we
can ever get consistent behavior amongst the various hosts/clients,
etc.
