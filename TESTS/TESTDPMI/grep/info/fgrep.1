       GGrreepp searches the named input _f_i_l_e_s (or standard input  if
       no files are named, or the file name -- is given) for lines
       containing a match to the given _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  By default, ggrreepp
       prints the matching lines.

       There  are three major variants of ggrreepp, controlled by the
       following options.
       --GG,, ----bbaassiicc--rreeggeexxpp
              Interpret _p_a_t_t_e_r_n as  a  basic  regular  expression
              (see below).  This is the default.
       --EE,, ----eexxtteennddeedd--rreeggeexxpp
              Interpret _p_a_t_t_e_r_n as an extended regular expression
              (see below).
       --FF,, ----ffiixxeedd--ssttrriinnggss
              Interpret _p_a_t_t_e_r_n as a list of fixed strings, sepa-
              rated by newlines, any of which is to be matched.
       In  addition,  two  variant  programs  eeggrreepp and ffggrreepp are
       available.   EEggrreepp  is  similar  (but  not  identical)  to
       ggrreepp --EE, and is compatible with the historical Unix eeggrreepp.
       FFggrreepp is the same as ggrreepp --FF.

       All variants of ggrreepp understand the following options:
       --nnuumm   Matches will be printed with _n_u_m lines  of  leading
              and  trailing  context.   However,  ggrreepp will never
              print any given line more than once.
       --AA  nnuumm ,, ----aafftteerr--ccoonntteexxtt==NNUUMM
              Print _n_u_m lines of trailing context after  matching
              lines.
       --BB  nnuumm ,, ----bbeeffoorree--ccoonntteexxtt==NNUUMM
              Print  _n_u_m lines of leading context before matching
              lines.
       --CC,, ----ccoonntteexxtt
              Equivalent to --22.
       --VV,, ----vveerrssiioonn
              Print the version number of ggrreepp to standard error.
              This  version  number should be included in all bug
              reports (see below).

              Suppress  normal  output; instead print the name of
              each input file from which no output would normally
              have  been  printed.  The scanning will stop on the

       --UU,, ----bbiinnaarryy
              Treat the file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-
              DOS and MS-Windows, ggrreepp guesses the file  type  by
              looking at the contents of the first 32KB read from
              the file.  If ggrreepp decides the file is a text file,
              it  strips the CR characters from the original file
              contents (to make regular expressions with ^^ and  $$
              work  correctly).   Specifying  --UU  overrules  this
              guesswork, causing all files to be read and  passed
              to  the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is
              a text file with CR/LF pairs at  the  end  of  each
              line,  this  will cause some regular expressions to
              fail.  This option is only supported on MS-DOS  and
              MS-Windows.
       --uu,, ----uunniixx--bbyyttee--ooffffsseettss
              Report Unix-style byte offsets.  This switch causes
              ggrreepp to report byte offsets as  if  the  file  were
              Unix-style  text  file,  i.e.  with  CR  characters
              stripped off.  This will produce results  identical
              to running ggrreepp on a Unix machine.  This option has
              no effect unless --bb option is also used; it is only
              supported on MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

       A  regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of
       strings.  Regular expressions are constructed  analogously
       to  arithmetic  expressions, by using various operators to
       combine smaller expressions.

       GGrreepp understands two different versions of regular expres-
       sion  syntax:  ``basic''  and  ``extended.''  In GNU ggrreepp,
       there is no difference in  available  functionality  using
       either  syntax.   In  other implementations, basic regular
       expressions are less powerful.  The following  description
       applies  to  extended regular expressions; differences for
       basic regular expressions are summarized afterwards.

       The fundamental building blocks are  the  regular  expres-
       sions  that  match  a  single character.  Most characters,
       including all letters and digits, are regular  expressions
       that  match  themselves.   Any  metacharacter with special
       meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.

       A list of characters enclosed by [[ and ]] matches any  sin-
       gle  character in that list; if the first character of the
       list is the caret ^^ then it matches any character  _n_o_t  in
       the   list.    For   example,   the   regular   expression
       [[00112233445566778899]] matches any single digit.  A range  of  ASCII
       characters  may  be specified by giving the first and last
       characters, separated by a hyphen.  Finally, certain named
       classes  of  characters  are  predefined.  Their names are
       self  explanatory,  and  they  are  [[::aallnnuumm::]],  [[::aallpphhaa::]],
       [[::ccnnttrrll::]],  [[::ddiiggiitt::]],  [[::ggrraapphh::]],  [[::lloowweerr::]],  [[::pprriinntt::]],
       [[::ppuunncctt::]],  [[::ssppaaccee::]],  [[::uuppppeerr::]],  and  [[::xxddiiggiitt::]]..   For

       example,  [[[[::aallnnuumm::]]]] means [[00--99AA--ZZaa--zz]], except the latter
       form is  dependent  upon  the  ASCII  character  encoding,
       whereas  the  former is portable.  (Note that the brackets
       in these class names are part of the symbolic  names,  and
       must  be  included  in addition to the brackets delimiting
       the bracket list.)  Most metacharacters lose their special
       meaning  inside  lists.   To  include a literal ]] place it
       first in the list.  Similarly,  to  include  a  literal  ^^
       place  it  anywhere but first.  Finally, to include a lit-
       eral -- place it last.

       The period ..  matches any single character.  The symbol \\ww
       is  a  synonym  for  [[[[::aallnnuumm::]]]]  and  \\WW is a synonym for
       [[^^[[::aallnnuumm]]]].

       The caret ^^ and the dollar sign $$ are metacharacters  that
       respectively  match  the empty string at the beginning and
       end of a line.  The symbols \\<< and \\>>  respectively  match
       the  empty string at the beginning and end of a word.  The
       symbol \\bb matches the empty string at the edge of a  word,
       and  \\BB  matches the empty string provided it's _n_o_t at the
       edge of a word.

       A regular expression matching a single  character  may  be
       followed by one of several repetition operators:
       ??      The  preceding item is optional and matched at most
              once.
       **      The preceding item will be  matched  zero  or  more
              times.
       ++      The  preceding  item  will  be  matched one or more
              times.
       {{_n}}    The preceding item is matched exactly _n times.
       {{_n,,}}   The preceding item is matched _n or more times.
       {{,,_m}}   The preceding item is optional and  is  matched  at
              most _m times.
       {{_n,,_m}}  The preceding item is matched at least _n times, but
              not more than _m times.

       Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting
       regular  expression  matches any string formed by concate-
       nating two substrings that respectively match the concate-
       nated subexpressions.

       Two  regular expressions may be joined by the infix opera-
       tor ||; the resulting regular expression matches any string
       matching either subexpression.

       Repetition  takes  precedence over concatenation, which in
       turn takes precedence over alternation.   A  whole  subex-
       pression  may be enclosed in parentheses to override these
       precedence rules.

       The backreference \\_n, where _n is a single  digit,  matches
       the  substring previously matched by the _nth parenthesized

       In basic regular expressions the metacharacters ??,  ++,  {{,
       ||,  ((,  and  )) lose their special meaning; instead use the
       backslashed versions \\??, \\++, \\{{, \\||, \\((, and \\)).

       In eeggrreepp the metacharacter {{ loses  its  special  meaning;
       instead use \\{{.

       Normally, exit status is 0 if matches were found, and 1 if
       no matches were found.  (The --vv option inverts  the  sense
       of  the exit status.)  Exit status is 2 if there were syn-
       tax errors in the pattern, inaccessible  input  files,  or
       other system errors.

       Large  repetition  counts in the {{_m,,_n}} construct may cause
       grep to use lots of memory.  In  addition,  certain  other
       obscure  regular  expressions require exponential time and
       space, and may cause ggrreepp to run out of memory.

       Backreferences are very slow, and may require  exponential
