Fix Bug With Comments in QMAX.INI

If a line in QMAX.INI immediately preceding the [MAXEdit - Files]
section starts with one or more leading semicolons, the parsing
algorithm in MAXEdit gets confused and miscalculates the next position
in the file from which it should read data.  The effect is that
MAXEdit complains about not being able to open a file.	The actual
file name about which it complains is dependent upon the number of
leading semicolons in the preceding line's comment, but is taken from
the trailing characters in the section header.	For example, if the
preceding line begins with two semicolons, the file it can't open is
's]', the last two characters from the section header.

MAXEDIT.C	Use sizeof() instead of absolute constant.
		Don't strip leading semicolons and then check for a
		  leading semicolon.
